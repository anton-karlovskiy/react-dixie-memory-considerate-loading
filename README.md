[Live Demo](https://adaptive-loading.web.app/react-dixie-memory-considerate-loading)

This is a demo of the [Dixie Mesh](https://dixiemech.com/gmkdracula) keyboard implemented using React and the memory hook. It determines whether to load 3D model or static image based on the memory status of user's device.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
